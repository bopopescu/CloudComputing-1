The RPS value vary due to the cache of each instance. There will be cache saved in the instance after each round, 
therefore the RPS tends to increase compared to the beginning.

The RPS value in t1.micro vary less significantly as in m3.large. As m3.large has a larger cache space than t1.miro, 
it can save more data in the cache, making the RPS increase more significent.
